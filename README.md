The "Audio Interface using FPGA" project focuses on real-time noise reduction in digital audio signals using FPGA-based signal processing. By leveraging Verilog and FPGA hardware, the system efficiently filters out unwanted noise while maintaining high-quality audio output. The design incorporates low-pass filtering and mean filtering techniques to enhance speech clarity, making it ideal for applications such as communication systems, media production, and medical devices. With a 44.1 kHz sample rate and 16-bit depth, the system ensures minimal latency and high fidelity, outperforming traditional software-based noise reduction methods. Future improvements aim to integrate AI-driven adaptive filtering and support for higher resolution audio processing.
